		<h3>Accessibility</h3>
		<p>Accessibility is paramount to my work in front-end software development. As an able-bodied individual, I do my best to research the latest web accessibility practices from sources like <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" alt="link to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)">W3C</a> and read blog articles on accessibility. I understand that accessibility coverage may not be 100% but I do my best to ensure use of semantic HTML and browser compatibility.</p>
		<p>It is my core belief as a front-end developer that we have the power and tools to build the web so it is up to us to make the web accessible to diverse populations.</p>
